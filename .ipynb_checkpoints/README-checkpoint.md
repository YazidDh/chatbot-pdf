# üìö Multilingual PDF Chatbot

A conversational chatbot that allows users to interact intelligently with PDF documents using local large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances an LLM's responses by retrieving relevant document chunks from a custom dataset at runtime.

This architecture is especially useful for question answering on personalized or private data such as PDFs.

## üß† Overview

This chatbot works as follows:

1. Loads and reads a PDF using `PyPDFLoader`.
2. Splits the content into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. Generates embeddings locally with `OllamaEmbeddings`.
4. Stores and retrieves embeddings using `DocArrayInMemorySearch`.
5. Uses `ConversationalRetrievalChain` to generate accurate answers with context, powered by a local LLM (`OllamaLLM`).
6. Responds in a conversational format with memory and source tracking.
